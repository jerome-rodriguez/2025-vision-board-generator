# Project Title

## Overview

An easy-to-use vision board generator to help you envision the 2025 new year and help you reach your goals. This web app was developed in submission for BrainStation's 24hr Web API Hackathon (held in January 2025).

### Problem Space

The start of the new year can symbolize a clean slate or fresh start for many people to embark on new goals. While creating an aesthetic vision board may be time-consuming, costly, and not the most eco-friendly - our app addresses all these concerns in an easy-to-use app.

### User Profile

Anyone and everyone looking for an easy, fun, and eco-friendly way to create Pinterest-like vision boards - initially designed to start off the 2025 new year but can be used for other applications all year round such as the design of mood boards.

### Features

-clear entire vision board
-persist/store images on vision board (in event of refresh or closing of the browser)
